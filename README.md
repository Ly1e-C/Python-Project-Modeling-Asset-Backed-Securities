## Python-Project-Modeling-Asset-Backed-Securities (December 2020)
This Python coding project models the flow of payments within the waterfall structure of asset-backed securities. 
- Part 1 implements the waterfall mechanism that calculates the cashflows each period. 
- Part 2 calculates analytics such as IRR, Reduction in Yield (DIRR), and Weighted Average Life (WAL). 
- Part 3 uses Monte Carlo simulation to simulate default scenarios. Then it uses the analytics from Part 2 to arrive at the proper payment rate and rating for each tranche. 

I completed this project when taking the Baruch MFE course "Practical Python with Applications in Finance".
